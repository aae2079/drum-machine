Physical modelling is a form of sound synthesis that aims to algorithmically reproduce the physical characteristics of an instrument. For example, the physical modelling of a string was popularized as a form of synthesis by the Karplus-Strong algorithm that uses digital waveguide synthesis. Digital waveguide synthesis was formalized by Julius O Smith which consists of a various iterations of string modelling. 

This project aims to explore the complexity of the modelling a drum. The goal is to use physical modelling synthesis to reproduce a realistic drum sound representative of its membrane like characteristics.
